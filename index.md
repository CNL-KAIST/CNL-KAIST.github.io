## About

The Workshop on Computational Nanoelectronics (WCN) 2025 aims to bring together researchers working at the intersection of quantum mechanical simulations, semiconductor device physics, TCAD, and machine learning. The workshop provides an open and interdisciplinary venue to discuss state-of-the-art research and emerging challenges in modeling, simulating, and understanding semiconductor devices from a first-principles perspective.

The scope of the workshop includes molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT), nonequilibrium Green’s function (NEGF)-based simulations, and TCAD methodologies, with an emphasis on applications to nanoscale and quantum semiconductor devices. A particular focus will be placed on advanced device structures and novel materials, while leveraging modern computational methods and machine learning techniques to accelerate simulations, improve accuracy, and enable new design paradigms.

Through invited talks from leading experts and contributed presentations from the community, WCN 2025 will explore both theoretical developments and practical applications, with the goal of accelerating research in this rapidly evolving field.
