## About

The Workshop on computational nanoelectronics workshop (WCN) aims to bring together researchers working at the intersection of quantum mechanical simulations, semiconductor device physics, and machine learning. The workshop provides an open and interdisciplinary venue to discuss state-of-the-art research and emerging challenges in modeling, simulating, and understanding semiconductor devices from a first-principles perspective.

The scope of the workshop includes molecular dynamics (MD), density functional theory (DFT), and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF)-based simulations, with an emphasis on applications to nanoscale and quantum semiconductor devices. In particular, the focus is on exploring advanced device structures and novel materials, while leveraging modern computational methods and machine learning techniques to accelerate simulations, improve accuracy, and enable new design paradigms.

Through invited talks from leading experts and contributed presentations from the community, the WCN will explore both theoretical developments and practical applications, with the goal of accelerating research in this rapidly evolving field.

## WCN 2025

The Workshop on computational nanoelectronics workshop 2025 will be held on July 23, 2025 at KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea. The workshop will feature in-person sessions, including keynotes, contributed talks, and panel discussions.
